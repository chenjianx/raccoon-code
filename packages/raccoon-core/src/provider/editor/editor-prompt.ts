Focus on:

3. Non-obvious APIs, assumptions, or edge cases

Keep the explanation concise and practical. Do not rewrite the code unless a tiny snippet is needed to clarify a point.`

2. Make the smallest correct change that fixes it
3. Preserve existing style and public behavior unless the bug requires a behavior change
4. Explain what changed and why

If the selected code is insufficient to fix safely, say exactly what surrounding code or runtime detail is needed.`

2. Simpler control flow
3. Robustness around edge cases
4. Fit with the surrounding code style

Avoid speculative rewrites, broad refactors, or changing behavior without calling it out. Provide the improved code and a short rationale.`
