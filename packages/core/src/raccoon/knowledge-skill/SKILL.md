# Knowledge

Load this skill to answer questions from Raccoon cloud knowledge bases.

> This is a **skill**, loaded via the `skill` tool. It is not a callable tool by
> itself. After loading, run the bundled client below with `bash`.

The bundled client provides these knowledge-base operations:

- `list-knows` lists selectable knowledge bases.
- `retrieve-knows` retrieves chunks from one or more selected knowledge bases.
- Personal requests use `/api/plugin/mcp/know/v1/message`.
- Organization requests use `/api/plugin/mcp/org/know/v1/message` with `X-Org-Code`.

## Required Inputs

This skill reads the active Raccoon OAuth credential from the local v2 database
(`opencode.db` under the host's XDG data directory). `RACCOON_CLI=1` selects
the `raccoon` data directory; other hosts use `opencode`. Set `OPENCODE_DB` if
the host uses a different database file. It reads the database without writing
credentials or rotating refresh tokens.

If no v2 database exists, it reads the legacy auth store:

- `~/.local/share/raccoon/auth.json` (or `~/.local/share/opencode/auth.json` as a fallback)
- or `XDG_DATA_HOME/raccoon/auth.json` (or `XDG_DATA_HOME/opencode/auth.json`)
- or `OPENCODE_AUTH_PATH` if set

It uses the `raccoon` entry from that file:

- `access` as the bearer token
- `enterpriseUrl` as the base URL

Organization scope is resolved automatically. The skill reads `orgCode` from the login
credential, and if it is missing (older logins), recovers it from the user's first
organization via the user_info endpoint. When an organization scope is present, requests
use the organization endpoint with `X-Org-Code`; a personal account with no organization
falls back to the personal endpoint.

When the bundled client runs through the Raccoon host's shell tool, the host
resolves the active connection first and refreshes expiring credentials through
the native integration. The standalone script does not consume a rotating v2
refresh token. If running it outside the host reports an expired token, run it
through the Raccoon host or refresh the Raccoon login in the app.
The Raccoon CLI also passes its selected channel database filename to the client.

Environment overrides are still supported:

- `RACCOON_BASE_URL`
- `RACCOON_ACCESS_TOKEN`
- `RACCOON_ORG_CODE` (takes precedence over the stored `orgCode`)

If the user names a knowledge base but does not provide an `internal_url`, list knowledge bases first and match by name. If no base is specified, list knowledge bases first and use the first returned `internal_url`.

## Workflow

1. If the target knowledge base is unknown, or the user just asks a general question, list knowledge bases and retrieve from the first returned `internal_url`:

   ```bash
   python3 scripts/knowledge_mcp_client.py retrieve --query "<question>"
   ```

2. If you need to confirm the available knowledge bases first, run:

   ```bash
   python3 scripts/knowledge_mcp_client.py list
   ```

3. If the user provided a specific base, retrieve from that base:

   ```bash
   python3 scripts/knowledge_mcp_client.py retrieve --internal-url "<internal_url>" --query "<question>"
   ```

   For multiple knowledge bases, repeat `--internal-url`:

   ```bash
   python3 scripts/knowledge_mcp_client.py retrieve --internal-url "<url-1>" --internal-url "<url-2>" --query "<question>"
   ```

4. Answer using only retrieved chunks unless the user explicitly asks for general knowledge.
5. Cite the source `name` and `internal_url` when available.
6. If no chunks are returned, say that no relevant knowledge was found.

## Output Handling

The client prints normalized JSON:

- `list` returns an array of knowledge bases.
- `retrieve` returns an array of chunks with `name`, `internal_url`, and `chunk`.
- `raw` can be used for debugging the underlying JSON-RPC response.

Use `--print-request` when debugging. It prints the request URL, headers, and
JSON-RPC body to stderr with `Authorization` redacted.

Do not expose access tokens in responses, logs, or citations.
